1. First: Reframe What This Game Is

Before mechanics, you must lock the mental model.

This is NOT:

A quiz

A casual game

A rigid time-bound test

This IS:

A Live Strategic Simulation

A Facilitated Foresight Arena

A Collective Intelligence Exercise

With Game Dynamics layered on top

👉 Treat the Game Master as a “Facilitator / Commander”
👉 Treat Experts as “Strategic Officers”
👉 Treat Levels as “Missions” or “Phases”

This framing alone changes how users emotionally engage.

2. Core Design Principles (Very Important)

These principles should guide every UI decision.

1️⃣ Psychological Safety

Officers must feel:

No wrong answers

No penalty for time extension

Collaboration > competition

So:

No “fail”

No forced cut-off unless GM decides

Time pressure = soft pressure, not threat

2️⃣ Live Presence Feeling

This should feel like:

“We are all inside the same room, thinking together.”

So you need:

Presence indicators

Live updates

Micro feedback loops

3️⃣ Game ≠ Cartoon

For Dubai Police:

Minimal childish visuals

Premium, command-center aesthetic

Gamification through interaction, not emojis

3. High-Level Game Structure (Improved)

Instead of “steps”, think in PHASES.

PHASE 0 — Lobby & Briefing (Very Important)

This is currently underused in your flow.

What happens here:

Experts join

See:

Game title

Objective

Total duration

Phases overview

See who else is present

Countdown to start

UX Improvements:

Live presence list

Status badges:

“Joined”

“Typing”

“Submitted”

Subtle ambient timer (not aggressive)

👉 This builds anticipation.

4. Time System (Your Biggest Strength — Refine It)

Your extension system is excellent. Make it feel intentional.

Improve the Time Mechanics

Instead of “timer ends”, use:

⏱️ Soft Timer

Timer turns amber when time is nearly over

Timer turns red only after GM final termination

✋ Time Extension (“Raise Hand”)

Rename it to something thematic:

“Request More Time”

“Continue Analysis”

“Hold the Phase”

What happens:

Expert taps → GM sees:

Expert name

Reason (optional quick tag)

“Refining idea”

“Team discussion”

“Needs clarity”

GM actions:

Approve +5 / +10 minutes

Ignore (timer continues)

Message player/group

👉 This feels collaborative, not permission-based.

5. Phase-by-Phase UX & Game Improvements

Now let’s go through each phase and upgrade it.

PHASE 1 — Focal Topics (Idea Generation)
Expert Experience (Improve It)

Instead of:

“Enter focal topics”

Make it:

“What forces will shape this future?”

UI Ideas:

Input as cards, not a list

Each card:

Title

Optional short description

Show:

“You’ve added 3 topics”

“Team has added 14 topics”

Gamified Micro-feedback:

Submitting before soft-time ends → subtle “On Time” indicator

No leaderboard, just affirmation

Game Master Experience

GM dashboard shows:

Live topic feed (cards appearing in real-time)

Submission heat:

Who submitted

Who is still typing

Time extension requests panel

GM powers:

Pin a topic (highlight importance)

Merge similar topics later (not now)

PHASE 2 — Focal Topic Voting (Make This Strategic)
Improve Voting UX

Instead of simple voting, use a 2-axis voting:

Impact (Low → High)

Uncertainty / Probability (Low → High)

Visual:

Each topic appears on a quadrant grid

Experts drag or rate sliders

This does 3 things:

Feels analytical

Feels interactive

Produces better foresight output

GM Selection Moment (Make It Ceremonial)

This is a key emotional moment.

GM action:

“Finalize Focal Topics”

Show:

Topics highlighted

Others fade out

Transition animation

Experts see:

“Selected Focus Areas Confirmed”

This makes progress felt.

PHASE 3 — Theme Assignment (6 STEEP-Security)
Improve Assignment Logic

Instead of silent auto-assign:

Show:

“You’ve been assigned to: TECHNOLOGY”

Allow:

GM override

Optional player swap request (rare but powerful)

Theme rooms:

Each theme feels like a sub-room

Experts know:

Who is in their theme

What focal topic they’re addressing

PHASE 4 — Challenges (Deep Thinking Phase)
Expert UX Improvements

Instead of raw text input:

Structured challenge card:

Challenge title

Description

Why it matters

Time horizon (optional)

Show:

“Team has submitted 6 challenges”

“You can still refine until termination”

GM Challenge Consolidation (Very Important)

Make this transparent but controlled.

GM actions:

Merge challenges (drag + merge)

Rename consolidated challenge

Tag themes

Experts see:

“Challenges are being consolidated”

Visual merge animation (trust-building)

PHASE 5 — Challenge Voting (Final Prioritization)

Same voting logic as before, but:

Fewer items

Higher stakes

Add:

“This will shape the final report”

No rushing here — keep the timer softer.

PHASE 6 — Reports (Knowledge Capture Phase)

This is where games usually die. You must keep engagement.

Expert Report UX

Instead of a blank editor:

Guided sections:

Situation

Risks

Opportunities

Signals

Recommendations

Progress indicator:

“Report 60% complete”

Time extension works the same.

GM Final Consolidation

GM tools:

View all reports side-by-side

Highlight key insights

Generate Draft Master Report

Optional AI assist (later):

Summarize themes

Identify patterns

Preserve human authority

6. Game Feedback & Closure (Currently Missing)

You MUST add this.

End of Game Experience

Experts see:

“Mission Completed”

Timeline of what was achieved

Key outputs:

Selected focal topics

Final challenges

Strategic insights

GM sees:

Participation metrics

Engagement heatmap

Who contributed where

This gives closure and value.

7. Gamification (Subtle, Professional)

Avoid:

Points

Leaderboards

Avatars

Use instead:

Status tags:

“Early Contributor”

“Analytical Thinker”

“Strategic Insight”

Phase completion markers

Progress rings

Gamification should feel like recognition, not competition.

8. What Makes This Truly “Live”

Add micro-interactions:

“GM is reviewing…”

“3 players requested extension”

“Theme consolidation in progress”

This keeps everyone emotionally present.

9. Final Recommendation: Architecture Mindset

Build this as:

State-driven

Phase-aware

Role-based

Every screen should know:

Current phase

Time state

User role

Group context
